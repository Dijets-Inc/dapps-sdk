# Dijets-Dapp SDKs

Deploy smart contracts, connect to Dijets Utility Chain using Dijets
This is a [Lerna project](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). The idea here is to aggregate all of our SDKs into one mono repo of smaller SDKs. This will avoid having to link a bunch of projects and make it much easier to work features across many SDKs at once.

## Getting started

run `yarn bootstrap` before doing anything. This will install, build and link all packages

With Dijets developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) that benefit from its incredibly fast speed, low tranasaction costs, and high scalability, making it an ideal choice for dApps. 

## Running example dapp

Make sure to run the getting started steps above, then:

1. cd into the `/packages/dijets-connector-example`
2. `yarn start`

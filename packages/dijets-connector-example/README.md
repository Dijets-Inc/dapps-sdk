# Getting Started with Dijets Connector

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Followed by the installation of decypher browser extension dApp connector `@dijetsinc/dijets-connector`.

This is meant to be the simplest example as possible and deals with the quickest way for connecting dApps to Dijets Decypher browser extension. Developers can use the connector and other SDKs to easily onboard users to their dApps without having to write a bunch of code.

## Connect to Dijets Button

You can open `src -> pages -> connect.tsx` to see a VERY rudementary version of the checking for Dijets connector. Again this code is based on the beta version and serves as an example.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page autmatically gets reloaded after any edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
